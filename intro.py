            '1. First, upload your images to the database.\n'
            '2. Then, select on which dataset you want to run the inference on. This will take a few '
             'minutes.\n'
            '3. Here, the model will show you how it succeeded to clusterize the results of the inference it ran. If '
             'there are classes it did not recognize, it will select a sample of representative images for you to '
             'annotate in the next step.\n'
            '4. On this section, you will be allowed to review the results of the models in more details, as well as '
             'annotate the unrecognized images. This will create a new set of data on which you can re-train the model.\n'
            '5. Once you have selected your preferred set on unknown images, you can click on the "Fine-Tune" button '
             'to fine-tune the model.')
